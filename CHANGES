Changes
=======

0.1.5 (2014-08-03)
------------------

- Fix implemented for NSInvalidArgumentException issue on 10.9.x


0.1.4 (2013-08-21)
------------------

- Menu class subclassing ListDict, a subclass of OrderedDict with additional insertion operations
- `update` method of Menu works like old App.menu parsing - consumes various nested Python containers and creates menus


0.1.3 (2013-08-19)
------------------

- `separator` global for marking menu separators (in addition to None in context of a menu)
- Can now have separators in sub menus using either `separator` or None
- Key and menu title not matching doesn't raise an exception since the situation would occur if the title is changed
  dynamically
    - Instead, a warning in the log
- Refactored MenuItem such that it subclasses new Menu class
- Menu class created
    - Wraps NSMenu using __setitem__, __delitem__, etc.
    - Allows for main menu to be easily changed during runtime as it now uses Menu class instead of vanilla OrderedDict
    - `clear` method for MenuItem + other irrelevant methods inherited from OrderedDict raise NotImplementedError
- As result of refactoring, could simplify menu parsing for App


0.1.2 (2013-08-11)
------------------

- Interval access and modification added to Timer objects
- timers function for iterating over timers
- Timer class now directly in module namespace
- More specfic case for trying callback with instance of App subclass as first argument
    - Point is to avoid catching a completely different TypeError, then sending 2 variables to a function consuming 1


0.1.1 (2013-08-07)
------------------

- Parsing data structures for creating menus is now more robust
- Fixed MenuItem __repr__ for printing instances where no callback function has been given
- Added `example_menu.py` to examples serving also as a test for new MenuItem changes
- Can now `del` MenuItems of submenus and it will be reflected in the actual menu
- `add` method for more convenient addition of MenuItems to a MenuItem's submenu
- Created module docstring


0.1.0 (2013-07-31)
------------------
