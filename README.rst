How fun!?

``rumps`` can greatly shorten the code required to generate a working app. No ``PyObjC`` underscore syntax required!


Use case
--------

``rumps`` is for any console-based program that would benefit from a simple configuration toolbar or launch menu.

Good for:

* Notification-center-based app
* Controlling daemons / launching separate programs
* Updating simple info from web APIs on a timer

Not good for:

* Any app that is first and foremost a GUI application


Required
--------

* PyObjC
* Python 2.6+

OS X 10.6 was shipped with Python 2.6 as the default version and PyObjC has been included in the default Python
since 10.5. If you're using OS X 10.6+ and the default Python that came with it, then ``rumps`` should be
good to go!


Recommended
-----------

* py2app

For creating standalone apps, just make sure to include ``rumps`` in the ``packages`` list. Most simple statusbar-based
apps are just "background" apps (no icon in the dock; inability to tab to the application) so it is likely that you
would want to set ``'LSUIElement'`` to ``True``. A basic ``setup.py`` would look like,

.. code-block:: python

    from setuptools import setup

    APP = ['example_class.py']
    DATA_FILES = []
    OPTIONS = {
        'argv_emulation': True,
        'plist': {
            'LSUIElement': True,
        },
        'packages': ['rumps'],
    }

    setup(
        app=APP,
        data_files=DATA_FILES,
        options={'py2app': OPTIONS},
        setup_requires=['py2app'],
    )

With this you can then create a standalone,

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py py2app


Installation
------------

Using pip,

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install rumps

Or from source,

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py install

Both of which will require ``sudo`` if installing in a system-wide location.
