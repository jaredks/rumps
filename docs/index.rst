Welcome to rumps
================

rumps is...

Ridiculously Uncomplicated Mac os x Python Statusbar apps!

rumps exposes Objective-C classes as Python classes and functions which greatly simplifies the process of creating a statusbar application.

Say you have a Python program and want to create a relatively simple interface for end user interaction on a Mac. There are a number of GUI tools available to Python programmers (PyQt, Tkinter, PyGTK, WxPython, etc.) but most are overkill if you just want to expose a few configuration options or an execution switch.

If all you want is a statusbar app, rumps makes it easy.
